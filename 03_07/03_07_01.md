# 3.7.1 Statistics - Statistical Measures

## a. Mean 
- The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is a commonly used measure of central tendency in statistics. It is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the number of values. The resulting value is the average of all the values in the dataset, and is often used to describe the "center" of the data.
- The mean is useful in a variety of contexts. It can be used to describe the average value of a variable, or to summarize a dataset with a single value. It can also be used to compare different groups of data, to detect outliers, or to generate predictions.
- Additionally, the mean is heavily used in the inferential statistics, where one want to infer about a population from a sample, for example in estimation of population mean from a sample mean.
- It is important to note that the mean is sensitive to outliers and skewed distributions, so it may not always be the best measure of central tendency to use, depending on the characteristics of the data.

## b. Median 
- The median is a statistical measure that is used to describe the middle value of a dataset. It is a measure of central tendency, similar to the mean. Unlike the mean, however, the median is not affected by outliers or extreme values in the dataset.
- To calculate the median, all of the values in the dataset are first arranged in order from smallest to largest. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the middle value is the median. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
- The use of the median is particularly useful when working with datasets that have outliers or extreme values, as it provides a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean. It can also be useful when the distribution of the data is not normal, which is the case for many real-world datasets.
- The median can be an appropriate measure of central tendency when it is important to identify the typical value of a dataset, without the influence of outliers or extreme values. The median is also useful for ordinal data, which does not have equal distances between points but is often used for categorical data.

## c. Mode 
- The mode is a measure of central tendency that describes the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is used to identify the value that appears most often in a set of data. The mode can be used with both continuous and discrete data, and it is particularly useful in the case of categorical data. The mode can be useful in identifying patterns or trends in data, and can be used in combination with other measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median, to get a more complete picture of the data.
- One use of mode is in descriptive statistics, where it is used to identify the most common value or category in a dataset. Mode is a good measure of central tendency when the data is skewed, or not symmetrical, in which case the mean is not a good measure of central tendency. Mode can also be used in inferential statistics in combination with other statistical methods to make predictions or estimate population characteristics.
- It's also important to note that a dataset could have multiple mode, or none at all, it depends on the data distribution.

## d. Quartiles
- Quartiles are a type of measure of statistical dispersion. They divide a dataset into four equal parts, or quarters, and are used to identify the spread of the data. The three quartiles are called the first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3).
- The first quartile, or Q1, is also known as the lower quartile and represents the 25th percentile of the dataset. It is the value that separates the lowest 25% of the data from the rest of the dataset.
- The second quartile, or Q2, is also known as the median and represents the 50th percentile of the dataset. It is the value that separates the lowest 50% of the data from the highest 50% of the data.
- The third quartile, or Q3, is also known as the upper quartile and represents the 75th percentile of the dataset. It is the value that separates the lowest 75% of the data from the highest 25% of the data.
- Quartiles are commonly used in data analysis to understand the spread of the data, and to identify outliers or unusually large or small values. They are often used in combination with other measures of dispersion, such as the range and interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third and first quartile.
- Quartiles are used in many fields, including finance, economics, and healthcare to measure the spread of data, identify outliers, and make decisions.

## e. Standard Deviation 
- The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data values. It is defined as the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- The standard deviation is often used in statistics to describe the distribution of a dataset, and it is a commonly used measure of the degree of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It can be used to compare different datasets, as well as to identify outliers or unusual observations in a dataset.
- In the context of statistical measures, it can be used to measure how much the data points in a sample deviate from the mean. If the standard deviation is small, it means that the data points are very close to the mean and the data set is more tightly grouped around the mean. If the standard deviation is large, it means that the data points are spread out over a larger range and the data set is more dispersed.
- It is also commonly used in hypothesis testing, for example, to determine the confidence intervals for a population mean. It also used in statistical models, as it allows to check the assumptions of normality.
- In machine learning, it is used in the preprocessing step of data normalization, that helps in the convergence of optimization algorithms.

## f. Variance 
- The purpose of variance in the context of statistical measures is to provide a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data. Variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the set.
- The use of variance is to provide a way to understand how much the data points in a set differ from the mean. A high variance indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values, while a low variance indicates that the data points are relatively close to the mean. Variance can be used to compare the spread of different sets of data, or to compare different variables within the same dataset.
- In many cases, a related measure, standard deviation (square root of variance) is used instead of variance, because it has the same unit of measure as the data, which makes it easier to interpret and compare.
- Additionally, variance is an important measure in many statistical and machine learning models, such as linear regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

## g. Covariance 
- Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables, and how they vary together. The purpose of covariance is to indicate the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. A positive covariance means that the variables are positively correlated, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. A negative covariance means that the variables are negatively correlated, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. And a zero covariance means that there is no linear relationship between the variables.
- The use of covariance is to understand the relationship between two variables. It can be used to identify the relationship between the variables in a dataset and also to identify which variables have a strong relationship with the target variable in a supervised learning problem. The covariance can be used in combination with other statistical measures like correlation and variance to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between variables and to help identify patterns or trends in the data.
- It should be noted that covariance have some drawbacks, such as difficulty to interpret the scale of the variable and its unit. Correlation (Pearson or Spearman) is often a better choice to understand the relationship between variable in a more intuitive and scale-invariant way.
