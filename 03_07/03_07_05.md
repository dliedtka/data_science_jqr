# 3.7.5 Statistics - Hypothesis Testing Techniques 

## a. P-Values
- P-values are used in hypothesis testing to help determine the level of statistical significance of an observed effect in a sample. The p-value is calculated based on the sample data and a null hypothesis, which is a statement about the population that is assumed to be true unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed effect or a more extreme effect if the null hypothesis were true.
- If the p-value is less than a predetermined significance level (e.g. 0.05), it provides evidence against the null hypothesis and suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, which describes the observed effect, is accepted.
- In short, P-values are used to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, and they inform decision making in hypothesis testing by indicating the level of confidence in rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis.

## b. A/B Test 
- A/B testing is a statistical method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a product, design, or marketing campaign to determine which is more effective. It is commonly used in marketing and website design to optimize the user experience and increase conversion rates.
- The purpose of A/B testing is to test a hypothesis about the effect of a change on a certain metric, such as click-through rate or conversion rate. In order to conduct an A/B test, a sample of users is randomly divided into two groups, with one group (group A) receiving the original version and the other group (group B) receiving the variation. The performance of the two groups is then compared based on a pre-defined metric to determine which version is more effective.
- A/B testing allows marketers and designers to make data-driven decisions by providing statistical evidence of the effectiveness of different changes. It is a valuable tool for optimizing websites and improving conversion rates, as well as for testing new marketing strategies and products.
- In short, the purpose and use of the A/B test is to compare two versions of a product, design or marketing campaign to determine which is more effective, by randomly dividing a sample of users into two groups, measuring a pre-defined metric and making data-driven decisions based on the results.

## c. T-Tests
- T-tests are a type of statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. They are used to test a null hypothesis that the means of two groups are equal, against an alternative hypothesis that the means are not equal.
- There are two main types of T-tests: the independent samples T-test and the paired samples T-test. The independent samples T-test is used to compare the means of two unrelated groups, while the paired samples T-test is used to compare the means of two related groups, such as before and after measurements.
- The purpose of a T-test is to provide evidence as to whether the difference between two group means is real, or simply due to random chance. If the calculated T-statistic is large and the associated p-value is low, it provides evidence that the means of the two groups are significantly different, and the null hypothesis is rejected.
- T-tests are commonly used in fields such as psychology, education, and medical research to compare treatment and control groups, to test the effectiveness of new treatments, and to study the differences between groups.
- In short, the purpose and use of T-tests is to test the hypothesis that the means of two groups are equal and to provide evidence of whether the difference between the two group means is real or due to random chance.

## d. Chi-Squared Tests
- Chi-squared tests are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant association or relationship between two categorical variables. The test is based on the chi-squared statistic, which measures the difference between expected and observed frequencies in a contingency table.
- The purpose of a chi-squared test is to test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two categorical variables, against the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship. The chi-squared test provides a measure of the strength of association between the variables and the p-value helps to determine the level of statistical significance. If the calculated p-value is less than a predetermined significance level (e.g. 0.05), it provides evidence against the null hypothesis and suggests that the relationship between the two variables is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
- Chi-squared tests are commonly used in fields such as social sciences, medicine, and biology to analyze categorical data and determine if there is a relationship between variables, such as the relationship between smoking and lung cancer or the relationship between gender and political preference.
- In short, the purpose and use of chi-squared tests is to determine if there is a significant association or relationship between two categorical variables and to provide a measure of the strength of the relationship, by comparing the observed and expected frequencies in a contingency table and calculating a p-value to determine the level of statistical significance.
