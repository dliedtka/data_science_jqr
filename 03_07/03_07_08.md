# 3.7.8. Statistics - Statistical Theories

## a. Central Limit Theory
- The central limit theorem is a fundamental result in probability and statistics that states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will converge to a normal distribution. The central limit theorem is used in various applications of statistics to approximate complex distributions by normal distributions, making it easier to perform statistical analysis.
- The purpose of the central limit theorem is to provide a way of understanding the behavior of complex distributions through the use of normal distributions, which are well-understood and have desirable properties such as being symmetrical and having defined mean and variance. The central limit theorem allows for the approximation of distributions that might be difficult or impossible to work with directly, such as the distributions of sums of random variables or functions of random variables.
- The central limit theorem has numerous applications in statistics, including hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and statistical inference. In hypothesis testing, the central limit theorem is used to approximate the distribution of test statistics, such as the t-statistic or the z-statistic, which can be used to make inferences about population parameters. In confidence interval estimation, the central limit theorem is used to approximate the distribution of the sample mean, allowing for the calculation of confidence intervals for population parameters.
- In short, the purpose and use of the central limit theorem in statistics is to provide a way of understanding the behavior of complex distributions through the use of normal distributions, which are well-understood and have desirable properties, by allowing for the approximation of distributions that might be difficult or impossible to work with directly, and having numerous applications in hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and statistical inference.

## b. Law of Large Numbers
- The law of large numbers is a fundamental result in probability and statistics that states that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will converge to their expected value. The law of large numbers is used to make probabilistic predictions about the long-term behavior of random variables based on a large number of observations.
- The purpose of the law of large numbers is to provide a way of understanding the behavior of random variables in the long run, allowing for the calculation of expected values and the assessment of the stability of the estimates. The law of large numbers is used to make probabilistic predictions about the long-term behavior of random variables, such as the average of a sample of random variables, by providing a mathematical result that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will converge to their expected value.
- The law of large numbers has numerous applications in various fields, including finance, engineering, and the social sciences, where it is used to make predictions about the long-term behavior of random variables and to assess the stability of the estimates. For example, in finance, the law of large numbers is used to make predictions about the long-term expected returns of investments, while in engineering, it is used to make predictions about the long-term reliability of systems.
- In short, the purpose and use of the law of large numbers in statistical theories is to provide a way of understanding the behavior of random variables in the long run, allowing for the calculation of expected values and the assessment of the stability of the estimates, by providing a mathematical result that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will converge to their expected value, and having numerous applications in various fields, including finance, engineering, and the social sciences.
