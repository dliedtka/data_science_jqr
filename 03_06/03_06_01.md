# 3.6.1 Probability/Information Theory - Probability Formulas 

## a. Conditional 
- The conditional probability formula is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The formula is typically written as P(A|B), which represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.
- In more mathematical terms, conditional probability is the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred, it is defined as:
$P(A|B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B)$
- It is used in various applications such as Bayesian statistics, machine learning, decision theory, and more. It also helps in understanding and predicting the likelihood of certain events occurring based on previous events, which can be useful in fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, among others.

## b. Joint
- The joint probability formula is used to calculate the probability of two or more events occurring together. The formula is typically written as P(A and B), where A and B are the events of interest. The joint probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of event A occurring by the probability of event B occurring, given that event A has occurred. This is written as $P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B|A)$.
- The join probability formula is useful in many statistical and machine learning methods. For example, it is used in Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical models to represent the relationships between multiple random variables. In addition, it is also used in hypothesis testing and estimation of parameters, where the goal is to infer the underlying probability distribution of the data.

## c. Independent 
- The independent probability formula is used to calculate the probability of two events occurring independently of each other. The formula is typically written as $P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$, where A and B are the two events in question, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of each event occurring independently. The formula assumes that the probability of event A occurring does not affect the probability of event B occurring, and vice versa. This is known as the "multiplication rule" of probability.
- This formula is useful in a variety of contexts, such as when you need to calculate the probability of two independent events happening together. For example, in medical research, it can be used to calculate the probability of a patient having a certain disease and also testing positive for a specific marker or biomarker. In business, it can be used to calculate the probability of a customer purchasing a product and also taking advantage of a specific promotion.
- In general, it can be used when events are independent and you want to find the combined probability of them happening together.

## d. Bayes Rule 
- Bayes' rule is a fundamental formula in probability theory that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities of events. It is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian.
- The formula for Bayes' rule is:
$$P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)$$
- where
    - P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred, also known as the posterior probability
    - P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B given that event A has occurred, also known as the likelihood
    - P(A) is the prior probability of event A,
    - P(B) is the prior probability of event B
- The rule states that the probability of an event A happening, given that event B has occurred, is proportional to the probability of event B happening, given that event A has occurred, multiplied by the probability of event A happening in general.
- The purpose of Bayes' rule is to allow us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event happening, based on new evidence or data. Bayes' rule is widely used in various fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and medical diagnosis. In machine learning, Bayesian methods are used for probabilistic models and Bayesian inference.
