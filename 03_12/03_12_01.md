# 3.12.1 Data Science Metrics/Techniques

## a. Regularization 
- Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and as a result, it performs poorly on new, unseen data. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function of a model, which discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature and helps reduce overfitting. The purpose of regularization is to improve the generalization ability of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting. Two common types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization.

## b. Cross Validation 
- Cross-validation is a technique used in data science to evaluate the performance of a model and avoid overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and as a result, it performs poorly on new, unseen data.
- Cross-validation works by dividing the data into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and evaluating it on a different subset. This process is repeated multiple times, using different subsets for training and evaluation, until the model has been evaluated on all subsets of the data. The final performance score of the model is calculated as the average performance across all subsets.
- The purpose of cross-validation is to obtain a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data. It helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and gives a more robust evaluation of the model. The use of cross-validation is common in machine learning, and it is often used in conjunction with other techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning, to improve the performance of a model.

## c. Grid Search/Parameter Tuning
- Grid search and parameter tuning are techniques used in machine learning to find the optimal values for the hyperparameters of a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model, as opposed to parameters that are learned during training. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate in gradient descent, the number of trees in a random forest, or the regularization strength in a linear regression model.
- The purpose of grid search is to automate the process of searching for the best hyperparameters for a model. It works by specifying a range of values for each hyperparameter, and then training and evaluating a model for every combination of hyperparameter values. The final result is the combination of hyperparameters that result in the best performance, as evaluated by a performance metric such as accuracy or mean squared error.
- The use of grid search and parameter tuning is important because it allows for the optimization of a model's performance. By finding the best hyperparameters, a model can be made to perform better on new, unseen data. Additionally, it can prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
- In summary, the purpose of grid search and parameter tuning is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model, which results in improved performance and reduced risk of overfitting.

## d. Metrics
### Loss
- Loss, also known as cost or objective function, is a metric used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. It measures the difference between the predicted values produced by a model and the actual target values. The purpose of loss is to provide a measure of how well a model is doing in terms of making accurate predictions.
- In supervised learning, the loss function is used to train the model. During training, the model's parameters are updated in order to minimize the value of the loss function. The idea is to find the parameter values that result in the lowest possible loss, which corresponds to the best possible predictions.
- There are many different types of loss functions, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, cross-entropy, and log-cosh. The choice of loss function depends on the type of problem being solved and the type of model being used.
- In summary, the purpose of loss as a metric is to provide a measure of a model's accuracy in making predictions, and to guide the training process towards finding the best possible parameters for the model. Loss is an essential component of supervised learning and is used to optimize the performance of a model.

### Area Under Curve (AUC)
- The area under the curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric in data science, particularly in binary classification problems. The AUC represents the performance of a binary classifier by measuring the ability of the classifier to distinguish between positive and negative examples.
- The AUC is calculated by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) for a range of classification thresholds. The TPR is the fraction of positive examples that are correctly classified as positive, and the FPR is the fraction of negative examples that are incorrectly classified as positive. The AUC is the area under the curve formed by plotting the TPR versus FPR.
- The purpose of AUC as a metric is to provide a single number summary of a classifier's performance, that is insensitive to the choice of threshold. AUC ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect classifier and a value of 0.5 indicating a random classifier.
- The use of AUC is particularly useful in cases where the proportion of positive and negative examples in the data is imbalanced, or where the cost of false positives and false negatives is not equal. In such cases, AUC provides a more robust evaluation of classifier performance compared to traditional accuracy metrics.
- In summary, the purpose of AUC as a metric is to provide a single number summary of the performance of a binary classifier, that is insensitive to the choice of threshold and useful in imbalanced datasets or when the cost of false positives and false negatives is not equal.

### Type 1 Error
- A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, is a mistake in which a test result indicates that a condition or event has occurred when it actually has not. In the context of data science and statistical hypothesis testing, a type 1 error refers to the rejection of a null hypothesis when it is actually true.
- The purpose of using type 1 errors as a metric is to quantify the risk of making a false positive conclusion. In hypothesis testing, the probability of making a type 1 error is controlled by the significance level, which is the maximum acceptable probability of making a type 1 error. A commonly used significance level is 0.05, meaning that the probability of making a type 1 error should not exceed 5%.
- The use of type 1 errors as a metric is important because false positive conclusions can lead to incorrect decisions or actions. In medical diagnosis, for example, a false positive test result may lead to unnecessary treatment, while in fraud detection, a false positive may result in an innocent customer being falsely accused.
- In summary, the purpose of using type 1 errors as a metric is to quantify the risk of making a false positive conclusion, and to control the probability of making a type 1 error in statistical hypothesis testing. This helps to ensure that incorrect decisions or actions are avoided.

### Type 2 Error
- A type 2 error, also known as a false negative, is a mistake in which a test result indicates that a condition or event has not occurred when it actually has. In the context of data science and statistical hypothesis testing, a type 2 error refers to the failure to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false.
- The purpose of using type 2 errors as a metric is to quantify the risk of making a false negative conclusion. In hypothesis testing, the probability of making a type 2 error is often denoted by beta (Î²), and is related to the significance level, which is the maximum acceptable probability of making a type 1 error.
- The use of type 2 errors as a metric is important because false negative conclusions can also lead to incorrect decisions or actions. For example, in medical diagnosis, a false negative test result may result in a serious condition being overlooked, while in fraud detection, a false negative may result in a fraudulent transaction going undetected.
- In summary, the purpose of using type 2 errors as a metric is to quantify the risk of making a false negative conclusion, and to ensure that incorrect decisions or actions are avoided. Type 2 errors are an important consideration in hypothesis testing and decision making, and should be balanced with the risk of making type 1 errors.

### Confusion Matrix
- A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model, and is commonly used as a metric in data science. The confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) predictions made by a classifier.
- The purpose of using a confusion matrix as a metric is to evaluate the accuracy of a classification model, and to gain insights into its behavior. The confusion matrix provides a comprehensive summary of the model's performance by considering both the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.
- The use of a confusion matrix is particularly useful when the distribution of class labels in the data is imbalanced, as it allows one to evaluate the performance of the classifier on each class, and to compare the performance on the minority class to the performance on the majority class.
- In addition to accuracy, the confusion matrix can also be used to calculate a number of other performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. These metrics can provide a more nuanced evaluation of the classifier's performance, and can help to identify areas for improvement.
- In summary, the purpose of using a confusion matrix as a metric is to evaluate the accuracy of a classification model, and to gain insights into its behavior. The confusion matrix provides a comprehensive summary of the model's performance, and can be used to calculate a number of performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. This makes it an important tool for evaluating and improving the performance of data science models.

### Validation Accuracy
- Validation accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on a validation dataset, which is a portion of the data that is held out from the training process and used to validate the model's performance. The purpose of validation accuracy is to estimate the performance of a model on new, unseen data.
- In the context of data science, validation accuracy is an important metric because it provides an estimate of the generalization performance of a model. Generalization performance refers to the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data, which is what we ultimately want from a model in practice.
- To estimate validation accuracy, the model is trained on a portion of the data, known as the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. The validation accuracy is then calculated as the proportion of correct predictions made by the model on the validation set. A high validation accuracy indicates that the model is likely to perform well on new, unseen data.
- Validation accuracy is used to help tune the hyperparameters of a model, or to select between different models. For example, one may train several different models with different hyperparameter settings, and select the one with the highest validation accuracy.
- In summary, the use of validation accuracy as a metric is to estimate the generalization performance of a machine learning model on new, unseen data. Validation accuracy is an important metric that helps to ensure that a model is well-suited to the task at hand, and helps to guide the selection of models and the tuning of hyperparameters.
