# 3.5.3 Data Analysis/Visualization - Correlation

- Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the association between two variables. In data science, correlation is used to determine the relationship between different features of a dataset. This can be useful in understanding how different variables are related to each other, and can help identify patterns and trends in the data.
- There are several types of correlation measures, including Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures linear association between two continuous variables, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, which measures the association between two ordinal variables.
- Correlation can be used in data exploration and visualization to identify features that are strongly related to the target variable, which can then be used to inform feature selection and model building. It can also be used to identify multicollinearity, which is when two or more features are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to unstable estimates in some models.
- Additionally, correlation can also be useful for identifying outliers and anomalies in the data, as well as for understanding the relationships between different subsets of the data.
