# 3.5.5 Data Analysis/Visualization - Mean and Distribution 

- Mean and distribution are two key concepts in the field of statistics and data analysis.
- The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is a measure of central tendency that is used to summarize a set of numerical data. It is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean provides a single value that represents the "center" or "typical" value of a dataset.
- Distribution refers to the way that data is spread out across a range of values. There are several common types of distributions, including normal, uniform, and skewed distributions. Understanding the distribution of a dataset can provide valuable insights into the data, such as whether the data is symmetric or skewed, and whether there are any outliers or unusual values.
- In data analysis, mean and distribution are often used together to gain a better understanding of the data. For example, a histogram can be used to visualize the distribution of a dataset and the mean can be used as a measure of central tendency. By comparing the mean and the distribution of a dataset, analysts can identify patterns and trends in the data, and make inferences about the underlying population from which the data was sampled.
