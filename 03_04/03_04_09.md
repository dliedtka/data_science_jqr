### Unsupervised learning

a. Clustering
    - K-means:
        - Randomly assign k-means to start. Assign each data point to the nearest mean. Then update the values of each mean with the mean of all the data points in its cluster. Repeat assignment and update. The algorithm converges when no assignments change. Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
