### Encoding schemes

a. One hot
- Frequently used to deal with categorical data, as using an ordinal encoding may create a fictional ordinal relationship in the data (if options are red, blue, yellow, using 0, 1, 2 respectively may make yellow "better" than blue and red).
- To implement, create a column for each categorical variable, and use 1 for true, 0 for false.

b. Binarization
- Divide a feature into two groups (e.g.- pass/fail, yes/no), implement with 0/1.

c. Discretization
- Convert a variable into a categorical encoding.
