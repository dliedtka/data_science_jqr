### Data cleaning

a. Missing values
- No observation for a variable (for an individual sample). Can be missing completely at random, missing at random (statistically impossible to tell the difference), and missing not at random.
- To handle:
    - Imputation- Values are filled in in place of missing data. Could use interpolation, where you choose from the discrete set of occurring values, or other methods.
    - Omission- Samples with missing data are discarded from further analysis.
    - Analysis- Applying methods unaffected by the missing values.

b. Outliers 
- A data point that differs significantly from other observations. 
- Can randomly occur, but often are a result of measurement error.
- For large sample sizes, outliers are expected and do not necessarily need to be excluded.
- It is less frowned upon to discard outliers when there is confidence in the data following a normal distribution. Truncation/trimming is an option, and Winsorring replaces outliers with the nearest non-suspect data.
- Usually a z-score of +/- 3 can be considered an outlier.
- Any data removal should be annotated.

c. Feature enrichment 
- Using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data (e.g.- edge detection in images).
- Important when you have lesser amounts of data, less robust algorithms.

d. Transformations 
- Convert data to another format to make it easier for processing.
- Can include standardizing data, character set conversion, encoding handling, etc.
