### Dimensionality reduction

Going to need to watch videos/read how to do all of these.

a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- A statistical technique to reduce the dimensionality of data.
- "Increase the interpretability of a dataset while preserving the maximum amount of information." (Think about being able to plot data with dozens of features on a 2D graph.)

b. Random Projections
- Reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in a Euclidean space.
- Simple and computationally efficient, trades a controlled amount of error for faster processing and smaller models.

c. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- Separate multivariate data into additive subcomponents.
- At most, one subcomponent is Gaussian and subcomponents are statistically independt of each other.

d. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- A factorization of a real or complex matrix.
- I think this allows for more efficient storage of data

e. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
-
